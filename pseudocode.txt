# pseudocode.txt

define a function that takes command options from the main:

    print the options available

    movement:
        (north, south, east, west (up, down):
        room1: North (room3), West (room2)
        room2: East (room1)
        room3: South (room1), North (if Torch: (down (room4)), if no Torch: (gameEnd))
        room4: Up (room3), South (finalRoom)
        finalRoom: if puzzle correct: Up (gameEnd)

    view inventory (a separate text file):
        print inventory

    get/pick up:
        add things to inventory (add to the text file)
        room1: None
        room2: Small Boots
        room3: Amulet
        room4: None
        finalRoom:

    room specific action (inspect):
        room1: If inspect:
            twirl (x3, gets "heavy air cloak")
        room2: If inspect:
            pull torch (x3, break torch), apologize (x1, get "torch friend")
        room3: If inspect:
            Amulet
        room4: Carry statue
        finalRoom (puzzle loop): If inspect:
            Options:
                If Put shoes on statue:
                    "Statue moves to stand in front of door on a previously unseen imprint on the floor"
                If Put Amulet on statue:
                    Nothing happens. Continue loop



    save/load action (if possible):
    input SAVE or LOAD
    Records onto the main story text maybe

    exit:
        Ends game


define a function that stores and gets log of actions (possibly if have time make a save/load ability?):
    Take the returns of the command function and save to a new text file (call it log.txt or something).
    Log what room the action was taken.


define a function that prints the story text onto the terminal:
    open story text
    read the story text
    have the story text be printed according to the commands
    (can probably use story text to save and load by writing to the story text with identifier)


main function:
    input command option as while loop with command function:
    while input != 'EXIT':
    list command options per room using if conditionals:
    if room1:
    output room1 story text on terminal
    have input read the choices available, using try except to stay in loop until a valid choice inputted

    call story read function
