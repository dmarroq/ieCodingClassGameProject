0. The air is cool and heavy, yet it seems to flow around you, like an ocean current. To the West there is an entrance to another room. Yellow light flickers from the portal, illuminating the room enough to see. To the North another room, this one dark and foreboding.
1. Firelight from a brightly burning torch mounted on the wall on your right illuminates a dead end. You see an old pair of boots at the far end of the entrance.
3. This room is empty save for an old, child-size statue of some sort of knight with a rabbit's head. It stands in front of the room exit in the South, facing a long, dark hallway.
4. After what felt like hours of walking, you finally reach a large room, a heavy iron door at the far end, intricately carved with what look like roots and antlers. At the center, near chest height, set inside a twisting ring of lifelike flowers, there is a large ruby, gleaming in the yellow light cast by Broken Torch. It has no lock and no handle to open it with. A meter away from the foot of the door, an impression of boots seem to have been carved into the cobblestone floor.
